# digital_media_shares_optimization

With modern technology, more and more media is being consumed digitially.  Peer to peer sharing of content over social networks which has created an entireley new distribution channel that has changed the way that people recieve their news.  If writers, content providers and advertisers can understand what about an article motivates the reader to click share, they can tailor their content to maximize it's reach.

For this project I created models to predict the number of social media shares a Mashable article will recieve and implemented these in a user friendly web application that provides content statistics, sentiment analysis, model predictions and offers content specific recommendations on how to increase reach.

I encourage you to play around with the working prototype here: http://54.86.1.93:5000
