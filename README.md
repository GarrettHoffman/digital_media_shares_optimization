# digital_media_shares_optimization

With modern technology, more and more media is being consumed digitally.  Peer to peer sharing of content over social networks has created an entirely new distribution channel that has changed the way that people receive their news.  If writers, content providers and advertisers can understand what about an article motivates the reader to click share, they can tailor their content to maximize its reach.

For this project I created models to predict the number of social media shares a Mashable article will recieve and implemented these in a user-friendly web application that provides content statistics, sentiment analysis, and model predictions and offers content-specific recommendations on how to increase reach.

I encourage you to play around with the working prototype here: http://54.86.1.93:5000

The Mashable URLs used in this analysis were obtained from this data set: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity
